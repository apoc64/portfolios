## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Fetch, serializer, testing 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
It was challenging.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Scheduled time to do it and did it.

* What did you learn?
How to be productive on a timed single day project from home.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
Getting more practice with personal/cultural questions

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed the whiteboarding.

Just start talking and writing, and things became apparent

* What did you learn?
Just glad I got more practice.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Learning Go, specifically creating structs to scan data out of database calls

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Google, Stack Overflow.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Figuring out a new language and completing it in a week.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Using memoization to initialize and return an instance of the database. Working with structs to decode JSON and read db calls in a very strictly typed language. Handrolling a setup/teardown for testing with truncating and seeding the db. 

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
Wouldn't change anything. There are some parts of the code I don't care for, but given the time I think I did very well.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
This was solo

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Trying to figure out how to use a vanilla js library in React

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
We didn't solve it. We Googled, we npm installed the most similar React library, created new components, got things from the index.html through the window, tried typing 'this' in various locations. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Learning to be productive on day one in an existing code base in a framework I didn't know.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
SQL EXCEPT statements, Using a CSS library from a CDN in React, Lots of things that don't work in React

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
Open Food Network

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Getting the environment set up.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Trying to get it working as best I could, then communicating with existing contributors over Slack, identifying a challenge they were unaware of, figuring out the solution by searching through the codebase, and refering to Rails docs, then adding comments to explain the solution to future contributors

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Finding my own issue that others were unaware of.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Setting up env, good documentation is key, good protocol for communication and contribution to an open source project.
(I tottaly stole this from the existing answer, but its 100% accurate for me)

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
I got good feedback on a cover letter, and bacame willing to make it more personal and interesting.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
Yes, the group was great to work with. We did a good job planning early on, so we were able to do a good job without too much difficulty. The discussion with students was interesting.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I think I brewed a pot of coffee almost every time I went in the kitchen. I wrote a blog on deploying a Go app which may be a useful resource to future students. Paired with some students in other mods

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Ability to go to a sr dev/team lead with a difficult issue, Ability to learn a new tech quickly, Ability to communicate technical issues.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
